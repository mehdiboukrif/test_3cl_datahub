Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance. It can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. Sources include:

- Oats
- Peas
- Beans
- Apples
- Citrus fruits
- Carrots

> **Tip:** Adding oats to your breakfast is an easy way to increase your soluble fiber intake.

### 2. Insoluble Fiber

Insoluble fiber promotes the movement of material through the digestive system and increases stool bulk. Sources include:
